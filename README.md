# Storytelling theme: World's Top Universities and their rankingsðŸ“Š

In this project, I have analyzed university rankings data to find how world'd top universities have performe over period of past 5 years. World's top insitutions are traiblazers in terms of cutting edge research and driving change in world to enhance people's lives acrosss the globe. Analyzing university rankings data I found some interesting insights which I would like to articulate here. so let's get started!

First, I visualized the TOP 10 university rankings over a perioud past 5 years (i.e. 2019-2023). I found that University of Oxford ranked on no. 1 position consistantly over a period of past 5 years. Harvard University improved its ranking from being at 7th position in 2020 to 2nd in 2023. It was interesting to note that UC, Berkeley which was out of the top 10 rankings, made it to the top 10 rankings from the year 2021.

Secondly, University of Oxford ranks 1st in research among all the universties in the world, Harvard ranks 1st in teaching followed by Stanford in 2023 rankings. As we saw UC, Berkeley made it to TOP 10 rankings in 2021 has scored above 90 in research while below 90 in teaching. 

To deep dive into more about how universities have scored in each of the metric. I ploted radar chart to to understand scores across research, teaching, citations, industry income and international outlook of universites in 2023. It was found that 8 of 10 universites which are in top 10 list have scored below 80 in industry income compared to research and citations. It says that studying in top universties does not always mean that if you have studied from top universities then you will be highest paid individual.

Lastly, I analyzed how number of students enrolled to these universities affect the teaching and research rankings of the universities. It was found the UC berkeley had the highest number of students enrolled with highest students to staff ratio among all the universities which can be cause of its low teaching score and high research score respectivaly.
